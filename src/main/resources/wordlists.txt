While
machine
learning
inference
models
are
already
transforming
computing
as
we
know
it,the
hard
truth
is
that
using
multiple,
gigantic
datasets
to
train
them
still
takes
a
ton
of
processing
power.Using
a
trained
model
to
predict
an
event
requires
much
lessbut
still
more
than
our
pocket
devices
can
currently
handle.Processing
an
image
with
a
deep
neural
network
implies
billions
of
operations
â€”
huge
matrices
of
many
dimensions
being
multiplied,
inversed,
reshaped,
and
Fourier
transformed.
